# 🌍 Global Sales Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes global sales transaction data to extract meaningful business insights.  
It covers revenue trends, profit margins, shipping efficiency, product category performance, and regional sales variations.  
The analysis leverages Python for data wrangling, transformation, and visualization.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains records of global sales transactions with details such as:
- **Region & Country** – Geographical location of sales.
- **Item Type** – Product category sold.
- **Sales Channel** – Online or Offline.
- **Order Priority** – Urgency of the order (High, Medium, Low, Critical).
- **Order & Ship Dates** – Timeline for sales and shipping.
- **Units Sold, Unit Price, Unit Cost** – Sales and cost details.
- **Revenue, Total Cost, Total Profit** – Calculated business metrics.

## 📊 Techniques Used
- **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values, fixing date formats.
- **Feature Engineering** – Extracting year/month from dates, calculating shipping duration, profit margins.
- **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis** – To explore relationships between multiple variables.
- **Visualizations** – Bar charts, heatmaps, scatter plots, boxplots, and pivot tables.

## 📈 Example Insights
- **Faster shipping** does not always guarantee higher profits.
- Some regions excel in **offline sales**, while others dominate **online markets**.
- A few product types generate **high revenue but low profit margins**.
- Seasonal patterns and **regional trends** affect sales performance.
